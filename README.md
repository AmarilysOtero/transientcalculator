# Transient Calculator
Research Project @UPRM.
The Group Members consist of **Amarilys, Diego and Gradmar**

## Summary

The project aims to explore the mathematical concepts and computational techniques related to the study of the behavior of the "transient" in "AND" networks by implementing a series of algorithms and computational tools, including the generation of dependency graphs and the calculation of the length of the "transient"
